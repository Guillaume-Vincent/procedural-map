# Python Procedural Map Generator

Procedural map generator coded in python. The map consists of an image with different colored pixels, representing different terrain types, created thanks to [Python Imaging Library](https://python-pillow.org/) and [Perlin Noise Library](https://pypi.org/project/noise/) for python.
